            To Document My CS Learning Journey

            <p>
                Starting from a computer novice, I quickly started learning C language. Although my foundation may not be solid, after completing over a hundred episodes of classes, I felt a great sense of achievement, which undoubtedly became the beginning of my CS learning.

            <li>Addicted to ACM</li>
            <p>
                In order to earn extra points in the exam competition, I went to learn about many competitions and started my ACM journey by chance. I spent day and night practicing and learning, and during that time, I truly experienced the joy of learning.
            </p>
            <li>Crazy study</li>
            <p>
                But after a while, I realized that my mathematical foundation had become a burden on my ACM journey and I had to turn to other directions. Therefore, I started learning on various websites. During this time, I learned languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and realized that languages were just tools.

            <p>
                I have learned a lot of language knowledge, but it is of no use and there is no immediate feedback like brushing ACM. I feel like I haven't learned anything, so I started a quite long period of confusion. During this time, I was at a loss, like a headless fly, seeing what to learn. I tried courses such as Python web crawling, web development, network security, and operating systems, but all of them were abandoned due to a lack of sense of achievement.

            <li>Go back on the right track: <a href="https://csdiy.wiki" >CS自学指南</a></li>
            <p>
                I actually knew this guide a long time ago, but before, I was too eager for quick success and was at a loss when I looked at the various online courses, which led to not studying it seriously. Later, when I focused on studying it, I opened the door to a new world,
                This is what a CSer should learn, and there is one course that left a deep impression on me:<a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/">MIT-Missing-Semester</a>。
                As its name suggests, A Missing Semester in Computer Teaching, this course is not about teaching you how to code, but about teaching you basic tools and knowledge, laying the foundation for future learning.
